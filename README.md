# IPL-Project
All the queries listed in the query.pdf are solved in pgAdmin(PostgreSQL).
This project was a part of the Summer Training - SQL for Data Analytics offered by Internshala.
In this training, I learnt different data operations, joins, subqueries, and other functions to build a strong foundation.
